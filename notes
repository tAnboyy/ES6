es6 = es5 + more features

var declaration- hoisted, function scope, can be redeclared
let declaration- not hoisted, block scope {}, cannot be redeclared
const declaration- not hoisted, block scope, cannot be redeclared

prefer const over let over var
use const if reassignment not expected
    let if reassignment expected

arrow function-
short,concise syntax for writing functions
simplifies behaviour of 'this' keyword

//11- lexical this
arrow function wont create its own this, rather uses parent's this
to use this from execution context, use arrow function.. else use regular JS function.

//12- default function parameters
concept

//13- rest operator
rest parameter syntax.. represents indefinite number of arguments as an array

//14- spread operator
opposite of rest
rest combines, used in function declaration
spread splits, used in function call

//15, 16- es6 object literals features

//17 destructuring arrays
items of array pulled out and assigned to individual variables

//18 destructuring objects
same concept as arrays except {}, alias

//19 string templates
convenient way to work with strings
concatenation, single double quotes usage, multi-line strings made easier to work with

//20 for of loop
similar to for loop but loops over iterables
used on arrays,strings

//21 classes
just syntactical sugar to existing prototype based inheritance
classes are functions(typeof) but are not hoisted,whereas functions are hoisted
instance created using new keyword
adding a method to class is the same as adding a method to class's prototype

//22 class body and methods
class body can have only methods and not properties
3 types of methods- 1.constructor (only 1 per class).. constructor called when object/instance of class created
                    2.static method.. static keyword, can call without creating an object
                    3.prototype method.. called through object/instance
